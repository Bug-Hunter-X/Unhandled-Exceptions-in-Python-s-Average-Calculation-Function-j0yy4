This repository contains a simple Python function that calculates the average of a list of numbers.  The initial version demonstrates a common error: neglecting to handle exceptions such as ZeroDivisionError (when the list is empty) and TypeError (when the list contains non-numeric elements). The solution showcases how to robustly handle these exceptions using try-except blocks to prevent unexpected program termination.
